    
Given two equations, with unknowns a and b:

    C0 = BA0*a + BB0*b
    C1 = BA1*a + BB1*b

we solve for a and b:

   a = (C0 - BB0*b)/BA0
   a = (C1 - BB1*b)/BA1

   -> (C0 - BB0*b)*BA1 = (C1 - BB1*b)*BA0
   -> C0*BA1 - C1*BA0 = b* ((BB0*BA1) - (BB1*BA0))
   -> b = [C0*BA1 - C1*BA0] / ((BB0*BA1) - (BB1*BA0))

   by symmetry:
